Destination Stations!

Taking a look at Subscriber destinations, there is a relatively even distribution throughout Lower Manhattan, indicating that the subscriber service is likely used for residents commuting to work. The most popular destination for subscribers is Pershing Square North, right outside Grand Central Terminal.

If we look at Customer-Only data, we can clearly see where tourists are going. Several hotspots line Central Park, a major tourist destination. Additional hotspots appear near the site of the One World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan and Pier 78, a setting-off point for many boat tours. It would likely be worthwhile to deploy new-user resources at these sites to assist them.

The assumption here is that Customers, for the most part, are tourists and have not subscribed to the service.

Please note that age 50 was excluded as there was an anomalous peak of with that specific age. Additionally, the age groups were abrogated as the group of very old users (above 80) had suspiciously high trip durations.

Please also note that this capturing all repeat users as separate users because no user identifiers were available.
